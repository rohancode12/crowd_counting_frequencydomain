To set up a crowd counting model using data preprocessing (data_processing.py), CHF loss (loss_function.py), Model architecture (model_architecture.py) training (training_model.py), trainer (trainer.py), and testing (testing_model.py) in TensorFlow for the ShanghaiTech dataset.
Data Preprocessing (data_processing.py): Prepares the ShanghaiTech dataset for training, validation, and testing, Converts raw images and their corresponding dot maps into formats suitable for input into the model, Performs augmentation, cropping, resizing, and normalization, Output: Preprocessed .npy files or TFRecord files for each image and its corresponding annotation (head positions).
Characteristic Function Loss (loss_function.py): Implements the CHF (Characteristic Function) loss function. This loss function calculates the difference between the predicted density map and the ground truth density map in the Fourier domain. Output: Loss values during training.
Trainer Module (trainer.py): Defines the trainer class, responsible for the training loop and validation loop. This module manages how the model is optimized using the CHF loss. It handles loading batches of preprocessed data, feeding it to the model, and updating model weights. Output: Trained model, saved at regular intervals during the training process.
Training Script (training_model.py): Initializes and triggers the training process. Loads the preprocessed data, compiles the model, and sets up the optimizer. Calls the trainer class to start the training loop. Output: Trained model checkpoint files.
Testing Script (testing_module.py): Loads the trained model and evaluates it on the test set. Compares the model predictions against the ground truth and computes metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error). Output: Evaluation metrics like MAE and MSE.
Run data_processing.py to convert raw data into .npy or TFRecords for efficient loading.-   python data_processing.py
Run training_model.py to start training with the CHF loss and save checkpoints at intervals.-   python training_model.py
Once training is complete, run testing_model.py to load the trained model and evaluate it on the test set.-   python testing_model.py

Here trainer module (trainer.py) that integrates various parts of a deep learning pipeline. It primarily focuses on training and validating a crowd counting model using characteristic function loss (CHF loss).
